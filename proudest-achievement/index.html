		<h1>My proudest achievement</h1>
		
		<p>I am the most proud from the fact how much I have learned since I started at Channelforge and the journey I went through.
		When I was hired, I never used Angular.js before, and never heard of TypeScript, although I've been using JavaScript for some time in previous work and for personal projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			The CTO's faith in my learning capacity pushed me to investigate the technologies I was required to learn almost religiously and to set up AngularJS Dublin Meetup group, which was one of the best things I have done in my life. The amount of passionate and talented people I have met and worked with on meetups, workshops and conferences has only boosted my desire to deepen my knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>As my level of expertise in Angular.js and TypeScript deepened and JavaScript best practices evolved, I decided to re-architect the front-end codebase of our apps.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the refactor was not only to stay on the cutting edge of technologies, but mostly, to cleanup the code, make it more performant for the customers and easier to add new features.</p>

		<p>The small sample of this new approach can be seen on
